# KazemVPN: A Personal Journey into VPN Technology

Hey there! üëã Welcome to my KazemVPN project, built from scratch in C++ to really understand what's happening under the hood.

## My Motivation

This project represents my journey of learning about:
- Network tunneling and how packets are routed
- Encryption implementation in real-world applications
- The challenges of secure connection management

## What's Inside

My code is organized into several components that mirror how commercial VPNs work:

- **Connection**: My implementation of network connection handling
- **Encryption**: Where I've implemented AES-256 encryption for the data
- **Tunnel**: The virtual network interface that routes all the traffic

I've added extensive comments throughout the code to document my learning process and help others who might be on a similar journey.

## Getting Started

### What You'll Need

- C++17 compatible compiler
- Boost libraries (system, thread)
- OpenSSL
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- Linux or macOS

### Building It Yourself

```bash
# Create a build directory
mkdir -p build
cd build

# Generate build files
cmake ..

# Build the project
make
```

### Taking It For a Spin

```bash
# Connect to default server (127.0.0.1:8090)
./bin/KazemVPN

# Connect to your own server
./bin/KazemVPN 192.168.1.100 8080
```

To disconnect, just press Ctrl+C.

## Learning Notes

This project has taught me a ton about networking and security. Some key insights:

- VPN tunneling is conceptually simple but complex in implementation
- Encryption is only as good as your key management
- Network routing requires careful handling of edge cases

If I were building this for production, I'd need to add:
1. More robust error recovery
2. Stronger authentication
3. Support for standard VPN protocols
4. A user-friendly interface

## Proof of Concept: VPN Attack Vector

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY RESEARCH NOTICE ‚ö†Ô∏è**

This project also demonstrates a proof of concept for a potential VPN attack vector. The attack works by:

1. Establishing a seemingly normal VPN connection with a victim
2. Covertly hosting files from the victim's computer through the VPN tunnel
3. Allowing an attacker to download these files without the victim's knowledge

This research highlights a critical security consideration: VPNs are often thought of only as tools for protecting outgoing traffic, but they can potentially be used as channels for unauthorized data exfiltration.

**Ethical Considerations:**
- This code is shared for educational and security research purposes only
- The implementation demonstrates the vulnerability to raise awareness
- Use this knowledge responsibly to improve VPN security, not for malicious purposes

## Disclaimer

This project is strictly for educational and security research purposes. It should not be used in production environments or for any malicious activities. I do not condone or support any unauthorized access to computer systems or data.
